The CD does not provide any information about the tempo, key, or pitch of the samples, which means that they need to be tuned and synced manually. The CD also does not provide any license or royalty information, which means that the samples may not be cleared for commercial use . Therefore, music producers who use Zero G Datafile 1 need to be creative and cautious when working with the samples.
